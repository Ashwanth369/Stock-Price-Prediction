# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the Data Mining course, where we aimed to predict stock price trends by incorporating sentiment analysis of news articles. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in stock-related news articles, providing additional features for stock price prediction. The models implemented include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs).

## Project Scope
The primary goal of this project was to explore the synergy between NLP techniques and neural networks for stock price prediction. We incorporated sentiment analysis of news articles as an additional feature to enhance the predictive accuracy of the models.

## Features

### 1. Sentiment Analysis:

Utilized NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on stock news articles. Extracted sentiment scores as an additional feature for stock price prediction.

### 2. Neural Network Models:

Implemented and trained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). Optimized models for stock price trend prediction.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the potential of combining NLP techniques and neural networks for stock price prediction. Key findings, visualizations, and performance metrics are detailed in the accompanying report.

## Conclusion
The integration of sentiment analysis from news articles, coupled with advanced neural network models, showed promising results in predicting stock price trends. This project highlights the significance of incorporating textual data for enhancing predictive accuracy in financial forecasting.
